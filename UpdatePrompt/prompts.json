In 2023, there were 1,026,690 abortions accounted for, and likely more than that under the table.

Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have introduced “Shield Laws” to legally and professionally protect healthcare providers and volunteers who perform abortions. Many of these laws have assisted pregnant individuals who have opted for telehealth and medication abortion as a means for a safe and private abortion, particularly in six states where their shield laws protect healthcare providers who send abortions to banned states.
